# Fitbit-Heartrate-TCX-Creator
A chrome plugin that prepares an exportable TCX file from data scraped from the Fitbit non-GPS activity page

To install:

1. Download the Fitbit-Heartrate-TCX-Creator.crx (Chrome extension) file. A pop-up will appear along the bottom of Chrome asking you to Continue or Discard the download, click Continue. You will not be prompted to install it.

2. Click the three-dot button in the top right-hand corner and go to More Tools > Extensions. Add a check to the box next to Developer Mode at the top of the page.  Developer Mode will allow you to install extensions that are not hosted in the Chrome Web Store. However, please do so at your own risk, and make sure to read permissions for each extension very carefully. If you need to remove an extension, you can do so by clicking the trash can icon next to it on the Extensions page.  The Developer Mode should be used for testing purposes only, and turned off once finished.

3. Locate the Fitbit-Heartrate-TCX-Creator.crx file on your computer, then drag and drop it onto the Extensions page. A pop-up will appear showing you the permissions the extension will have, and asking you to confirm the install. Click Add to finish the installation.
